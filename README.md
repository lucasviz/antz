3rd party licenses and helpful resources are in the 'doc' folder.

The spirit of the 'ANTz-XR' designation is to hint at a potential (open source) roadmap for our HW vendors and us. In example, zSpace is part of the OpenXR working group (and they already have support for WebXR). We encourage others to follow this path!
